HW7: I am integrating function np.exp(x**3) 

## This repository contains several types of programs:
* `Random.py`
* `MC_Integration.py`
* `DiffvsN_integration.pdf` is the final pdf plot for HW7

## General info
* HW7 -   Implement a Monte Carlo integration to a function in one or more dimensions. Quantify the accuracy of the MC integral as a function of the number of sample points and compare with the accuracy of the deterministic methods from HW #6

## Code Usage
* Can be run from the command line using the `-h` flag to display usage options. 
* e.g `MC_Integration.py`
`python MC_Integration.py -N [number of intervals] -a [lower bound of integration] -b [upper bound of integration]`
